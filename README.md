# gistCyber
The gistCyber ontology is a sub-gist ontology. This means that it imports and builds upon the gist ontology.
Hence, the gistCyber repository is a sub-gist repository

## Unifying Ontology of the multiple Domains of Discourse in Cybersecurity
There are many domains of discourse required in a conversation about cybersecurity. The intent of gistCyber is to give a minimalistic ontology(ies) to cover the basic needs of the community.

### Domains within Cybersecurity
1. Cybersecurity Threat Intelligence
   1. Cyber Actors
      1. Adversaries
      1. Defenders
   1. Behavior Patterns
      1. Attack Patterns
      1. Threat Lifecycles
1. Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures
1. Common Weakness Enumeration
1. Common Attack Patterns Enumeration and Classification
1. Common Platform Enumeration
1. Computing
   1. Hardware
   1. Software
   1. Firmare
   1. Network
1. Risk
   1. Financial
   1. Reputational
1. Business Intelligence
1. Assets
   1. Business
   1. Personal
1. Controls
1. Resilience

The above list is by no means all inclusive. The gistCyber ontology was created to enable 
semantic interoperability between these many sub-domains of cybersecurity.

## The Importance of Structured Threat Information eXchange (STIX)
An important concept of protecting an enterprise from threat and loss is the concept of information sharing.
In order to facilitate sharing between government angencies and the private sector the Department of Homeland 
Security sponsored the development of the STIX language. The language is an exchange format not an ontology.

## The Relationship between gistCyber and other Ontologies
The gistCyber ontology has dependencies
1. Basic Formal Ontology
1. gist
1. gistComputing
